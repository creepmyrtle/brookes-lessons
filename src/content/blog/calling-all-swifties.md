Make 2024 your era!! Have you always wanted to learn how to sing, play the guitar or the ukulele? How about learning how to play or sing using all your favorite Taylor Swift songs?

Hi, I'm Brooke Corcoran and I've been teaching Taylor Swift discography to students of all ages since Tay's Fearless Era. Many instructors are retired rock stars only interested in teaching classic rock songs that they know, rather than songs from artists like Taylor Swift, boygenius, Chappell Roan, Paramore, Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo etc. Since those are some of my favorite artists, I would love to teach you how to rock like these female powerhouses.

I offer convenient online lessons — no driving or scheduling difficulties — learn from the comfort of your own home wherever you are located (I teach internationally!).

**Lessons available in:**
- Acoustic guitar
- Electric guitar
- Ukulele
- Voice
- Combo (voice + instrument)
